            <p>Main article: Spike and Tyke (characters)
                Spike (occasionally referred to as Butch or Killer) is a stern but occasionally dumb British bulldog who is particularly disapproving of cats, but a softie when it comes to mice (though in his debut episode, 'Dog Trouble,' Spike goes after both Tom and Jerry), and later, his son Tyke. In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo-in for a beating from the bulldog.</p>

          <p>
            In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo-in for a beating from the bulldog. Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon: his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness.
